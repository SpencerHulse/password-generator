# Password Generator Starter Code
## Description
This website features a random password generator. It allows users to select a length between 8 and 128 characters. It then asks them whether they want the password to use lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters, of which they must choose at least one. It then gives them a password that meets that criteria.
